Genshin Impact is an open-world RPG where you can explore the nations, play throughout the overarching story, and master the games combat through the combinations of different elements and their reactions toward eachother. This is a program designed to replicate/simulate the wishing/gacha system used in order to get more characters and weapons.

### Event Character Wish
* 4 ★ drop guarantee: If a player does not obtain any 4 ★ (or above) item within 9 wishes in a row, the 10th wish is guaranteed to be a 4 ★ (or higher) item. (On guarantee, the probability of getting a 4 ★ item is 99.4%, and the probability of getting a 5 ★ item is 0.6%.) This counter will reset if the player obtains any 4★ item.
* Featured 4★ character guarantee: Every time a player obtains a 4 ★ item, there is a 50% chance it will be one of the featured 4 ★ characters.
* If the 4★ item obtained is not one of the featured characters, then the next 4★ item obtained is guaranteed to be one of the featured characters.
* Thus it requires a maximum of 20 wishes to obtain one of the featured 4 ★ characters.
* 5 ★ drop guarantee: If a player does not obtain any 5 ★ item after 89 wishes, the 90th wish is guaranteed to be a 5 ★ item. (On average, a greater proportion of 5★ items are dropped between 74 and 90 pity.)
* This counter will reset if the player obtains any 5 ★ item.
* Character Event Wishes do not contain 5 ★ weapons in their item pool, as such each 5 ★ drop will be a character.
* Promotional 5 ★ character guarantee: Every time a player obtains a 5 ★ item, there is a 50% chance it will be the promotional 5★ character.
* If the 5 ★ item obtained is not the promotional character, the next 5 ★ item is guaranteed to be the promotional character.
* Thus it requires a maximum of 180 wishes to guarantee obtaining the promotional 5 ★ character.
* Counter and Guarantee carry-over: Each wish of the same type shares the above counters and guarantees, this means that your counters for the current Character Event Wish are carried over to the next Character Event Wish (but not the Weapon Event Wish or Wanderlust Invocation).
* For example, if one wishes 89 3/4 ★ items on Character Event Wish A, then the first wish on the following promotional Character Event Wish B will be a guaranteed 5-star character.
( Likewise if one wished a non-promotional 5-star character on Character Event Wish A, then the next 5-star character on Character Event Wish B will be guaranteed to be the promotional character.
### Event Weapon Wish
* Weapon Banner has yet to be implemented.
