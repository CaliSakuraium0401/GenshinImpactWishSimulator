|                         |           |
|:-----------------------:|:---------:|
|          Item           | Base Rate |
|    5 Star Character     |   0.6%    |
| 4 Star Character/Weapon |   5.1%    |
|      3 Star Weapon      |   94.3%   |

-   5 Star Characters have a 0.6% base rate of being pulled.
    -   If a 5 Star Character is not pulled by the 90th wish, the 90th wish is *guaranteed* to be a 5 Star Character.
        -   Anytime a 5 Star Character is received, this counter, known as *pity* will reset. *Pity* is carried across banners.
    -   Everytime a 5 Star Character is received, there is a 50% chance of the character being a *Standard 5 Star Character* or the *Promotional 5 Star Character.*
        -   If the player previously *did not* obtain the *Promotional 5 Star Character* when they received a 5 Star Character, then they are *guaranteed* to obtain the *Promotional 5 Star Character* next time a 5 Star Character is received*. Gurantees* are carried across banners.
        -   If the player *did* obtain the *Promotional 5 Star Character* when they received a 5 Star Character, then the 50%/50% roll occurs.
        -   Regardless if the player receives the *Promotional 5 Star Character* from winning the 50%/50% roll or from being *guaranteed,* they will always have to do the 50%/50% the next time a 5 Star Character is received.
    -   Upon failing to receive a *Promotional 5 Star Character* on the 50%/50% roll, there may be a chance to trigger *Capturing Radiance*.
        -   Upon trigger *Capturing Radiance*, then the *Promotional 5 Star Character* is received.
